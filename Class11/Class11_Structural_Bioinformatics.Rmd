# Structural Bioinformatics (Part 1)

# 1. PDB Statistics

```{r}
db <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names=1)
head(db)
```


> **Q1**. What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy?

```{r}
method.sums <- colSums(db)
round((method.sums/method.sums["Total"]*100), 2)
```

*Answer*: 87.55% of structures in PDB are solved by X-Ray, and 4.92% are solved by Electron Microscopy.


> **Q2**. What proportion of the structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
round((db$Total/method.sums["Total"]*100),2)
```

*Answer*: 87.36% of the structures in the PDB are protein.


> **Q3**. Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB.

*Answer*: There are 1,828 HIV-1 protease structures in the current PDB.


# 2. Visualizing the HIV-1 Protease Structure

> **Q4**. Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

*Answer*: The only atom visible in the water molecule is the oxygen atom. Hydrogen atoms are too small to visualize. Therefore, we can only see one atom per water molecule in this structure.


> **Q5**. There is a conserved water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have (see note below)?

This water molecule is HOH308:O.

> **Q6**. Optional


# 3. Using Bio3D

I need to load the library.
```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

```{r}
aa123(pdbseq(pdb))
```

Plot of B-factor

```{r}
plot.bio3d(pdb$atom$b, sse=pdb)
```

The ATOM records

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

> **Q7**. How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object?

*Answer*: There are 198 amino acid residues.


> **Q8**. Name one of the two non-protein residues.

*Answer*: One of the two non-protein residues is HOH.


> **Q9**. How many protein chains are in this structure?

*Answer*: There are 2 protein chains in this structure.


# 4. Comparative Analysis of Adenylate Kinase

> **Q10**. Which of the packages above is found only on BioConductor and not CRAN?

*Answer*: The "msa" package is found only on BioConductor.


> **Q11**. Which of the above packages is not found on Bioconductor or CRAN?

*Answer*: The "bio3d-view" package is not found on BioConductor or CRAN.


> **Q12**. True or false? Functions from the devtools package can be used to install packages from GitHub and BitBucket.

*Answer*: True.
